# {title}

About 2 years ago, when I started playing around with electronics to build a water tank refill system, I decided to experiment with sending data over wifi between Arduinos.
I bought an ESP 07 to use as a wifi module for an arduino,
but when it arrived I was unpleasantly surprised that its pin spacing was smaller than that found on a breadboard (2mm vs 2.54mm).
Being unexperienced and overly cautious I did not want to solder anything to it to adapt it to 2.54mm for fear of breaking it. That is where I left it until recently.

After finishing the Water Tank Refill System (without wireless capabilities) I decided to explore wifi connectivity once more for a potential future version of the system.

This time I bought 2 ESP01 wifi modules as they have easy to use 2.54 mm pins out of the box.

Little did I know I was going down an amazingly interesting yet challenging rabbit hole that by the end expanded my knowledge, skills and interest in electronics considerably.

### Trying to use the ESP 01

The ESP 01 (pictured above) can be controlled with an arduino by sending it 'AT' commands. Theres a bunch of them. 
They are used to tell the ESP to connect to wifi, set its mode, send data, enter deep sleep and so on.

I wired the module up to my Arduino, but for the life of me I could not get the AT commands to work.

Doing some research I found out that some ESP 01s might not have the correct firmware installed by default.
Thats interesting... So what exactly do they mean by firmware?

Turns out the ESP can actually be programmed and used as a micro controller, just like an arduino, and with the arduino framework!
Not only that but I was astonished to find out that it has a faster processor, more ram and more storage than an Arduino!
The biggest drawback was that it only has a handful of GPIO pins where as the Arduino has 36.

Following a tutorial I again wired up the ESP to the arduino but this time with the intent to program it and use it as a dedicated micro controller. I wanted to see what it was capable of.

So why is it still wired up to the arduino?
In the above photo you can see that the ESP is considerably smaller than an arduino, and as such it does not have a dedicated USB port that can be used to program it.
This is where the arduino comes in. The arduino lends its USB port to the ESP, acting as a bridge between it and the computer, allowing us to program the ESP.

It was not easy to use the ESP effectively when there was all these loose wires all over the place. 
To fix that I decided to try and make a breakout board for the ESP. The result of which you can see in the above 3 images.

It is not exactly masterful work but it does its job; hiding the wires and making it much easier and less error prone to work with the ESP.

This breakout board can now simply slide into an arduino, and the ESP into that. Easy and simple.

On closer inspection you will notice a button and switch on the breakout board. The switch indicates to the ESP in which mode it should be, ie Flash or Run mode.
The button is then pressed to restart the ESP and enter the indicated mode.
Imagine a settings page where you change something and then you have to hit save to apply it. It is basically the same idea.

Additionally I added some pin sockets to easily access the ESP's pins, these being RX, TX, GPIO 0, GPIO 2, 5V, 3.3V and GND.

### Sensor Prototyping

I felt quite accomplished to get the ESP working this well, but I did not really have a use case for it yet.
During my research I found that the ESP family of microcontrollers are freqiently used in IOT devices,
so I figured I'd also build some sort of IOT device with my ESP 01.

I decided on a temperature and humidity sensor as I had a sensor lying around.
I have a old mercury thermometer in my room at my fathers house and I thought it would be nice to have something of the sort in my apartment.

The first step was to build a prototype:

I hooked up my AM2320 temperature and humidity sensor together with a 20x4 LCD to the ESP, both over I2C and wrote a simple program to see how it works.
The ESP has 2 GPIO pins that can be configured to use I2C, this greatly expands the units capabilities as 
this enables it to control up to 127 individual devices at once with only these two pins, assuming each device I2C device has a unique address.

The LCD display was to big to my liking as I wanted to keep the sensor unit as small as possible.
There are smaller LCD displayes but I instead purchased two OLED displays, of which I have never used before.
One 0.91 inch display and one 1.3 inch display.

These OLED displays worked well, although the 0.91 inch one was a bit small so I switched it with the bigger one.

I experimented with displaying the time and date on the display in conjunction with the temeparture and humidity
but later decided against it due to space constraints. 
The Real Time Clock module also uses I2C.

Excluding space constraints, I believed it to be better to have the unit only do one thing. 
It does not need to display the time or date, we can get that on our phones or wall clocks already.
In addition I think trying to display to much information is not satisfying, glancing at the display from a distance and not being able to 
read all the information it provides makes me uneasy.

It should only do what it can do well.


### Design and Construction

I grabed a small prototyping PCB and started spacing all the compoenents out on it. The screen to the left, the sensor in the middle and the ESP on the right,
For power I used a micor USB plug that supplies 5V. This is steped down to 3.3V with a voltage regulator and after that 
I placed a capacitor to ease any possible power anomalies.
On the back You can see 2 pull up restistors that are used to make the I2C bus high as per the spec.
