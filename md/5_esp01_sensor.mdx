About 2 years ago, when I started playing around with electronics to build a water tank refill system, I decided to experiment with sending data over wifi between arduinos.
I bought an ESP 07 to use as a wifi module for an arduino,
but when it arrived I was unplessently surprised that its pin spacing was smaller than that found on a breadboard (2mm vs 2.54mm).
Being unexperienced and overly cautious I did not want to solder anything to it to adapt it to 2.54mm for fear of breaking it. That is whre I left it until recently.

After finishing the Water Tank Refill System (without wireless capabilities) I decided to explore wifi conectivity once more for a potential future version of the system.

This time I bought 2 ESP01 wifi modules as they have easy to use 2.54 mm pins out of the box.

Little did I know I was going down an amazingly interesting yet challanging rabit hole that by the end expanded my knowlegde, skills and intrest in electronics considerably.
