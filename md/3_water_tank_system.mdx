### Intro
When I was about 10,
I was in my fathers study room going trough all the interesting stuff he built and collected over the years.
He has a diploma in Electronics and build some truely amazing stuff way back when.

One of his old projects he told me about was a LED bilboard that could dislay text with a bunch of different animations.
They could slide in, roll out, be eaten by a macman or move accross the screen.
And he only used assembly! 

Naturally I askd him how these magical things worked, how do these black brics and other weird components result in something cool?

He probably did not expect me to understand, and I didnt, but he toldme they communicate with a language called binary,
and that language only consists of zeroes and ones.

I was awe struck, he proceded to write down 1 to 10 on a piece of paper with their corresponding binary representations.

Even though I did not understand exactly what was being shown to me, 
I was captivated none the less, he has sparked a quriosity that has only grown with time.
