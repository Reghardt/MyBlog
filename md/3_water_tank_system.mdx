# {title}

### Intro
When I was about 10,
I was in my fathers study room going trough all the interesting electronics he built and collected over the years.
He has a diploma in Electronics and built some truly amazing stuff way back when.

One of the projects he told me about was a LED billboard that could display text with a bunch of different animations.
They could slide in, roll out, be eaten by a packman or move across the screen.
And he only used assembly! 

Naturally I asked him how these magical things worked, how do these black bricks and other weird components result in something like this.

He probably did not expect me to understand, and I didn't much, but he told me they communicate with a language called binary,
and that language only consists of zeroes and ones.
After which proceeded to write down 1 to 10 on a piece of paper with their corresponding binary representations to demonstrate.

Even though I did not really understand what was being shown to me, 
I was captivated none the less, and that memory has stayed with me ever since.

### Backstory

In my hometown we have severe water shortages, not became of a drought or a lack of water but due to corruption and mismanagement.
The residential water supply will simply stop at random and sometimes stay off for days.

To remedy this people are drilling bore holes and installing water tanks.
My Father has one of these water tanks on a tower in his back yard:

[![Water tower](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/water_stand.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/water_stand.jpg)

This works great, but on occasion the tank would be overfilled and waste excess water. 
Or in contrast, the tank's water will be depleted if the bore hole has not been turned on for some time.

There are float valves available to solve these issues. This works similar to the float in a toilet's water reservoir, 
if the water level drops below a certain point the float will turn on the bore hole to fill the tank.
But this usually means that the bore hole's power line should visit the float valve before going to the pump itself.
The float valve simply acts as a switch in this case that turns on the bore hole.

To install a float valve the bore hole's power lines has be be dug up, rerouted and buried. This can result in a considerable amount of work.

One day I had the idea to to ask my father if he would be interested if I design and install a custom "float valve like" system myself to solve the issue. 
He said yes. This is that project.

### Early Development

I not only wanted to be able to start and stop the bore hole pump, but I also wanted to show what the current water level in the tank is.
I understood that there will probably have to be 3 distinct units. The sensor unit that takes water level readings.
The control unit that displays the sensor readings and acts upon them given some parameters.
And finally the relay unit that receives commands from the control unit to start or stop the pump.

The biggest problem I faced during planning was figuring out how to measure the water level in the tank.

I fist thought of making a magnet float on the surface of the water and have that slide up and down a pipe with coils warped around to detect the magnetic field at set points.
But having that scale to different sized tanks might have been difficult, additionally it would not have given a great measuring resolution.

The second idea was to have a flat disk float on the surface and to use a laser range finder to get distance readings from it. 
This might have worked but laser range finders are expensive.

When searching for laser range finders I stumbled upon ultrasonic range finders. The last time I used one of these was with my NXT Lego kit a great many years ago.
The idea behind an ultrasonic sensor in a water tank is that the sound waves would bounce of the water's surface as water is denser than air.
The time taken for the sound waves to return can be used to get the distance traveled and 
from that the water level can be calculated knowing a few other parameters like sensor height and tank depth.
The logic checked out on the internet and I decided to take the ultrasonic approach.

The second issue was communication between the units. I figured wireless would be great and found some NRF 01 transceivers that fit the bill.
In case they were not suitable I decided to buy some RS485 units which communicate over wire, just to be safe.

After receiving everything I had to build a proof of concept. It looked like this:

[![Prototype](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/first_prototype_crop.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/first_prototype_crop.jpg)

The left Arduino acts as the control unit, it receives sensor readings from the right Arduino that acts as the sensor unit.
They are connected to each other by wire (the black one under the keyboard), each using a RS485 transceiver to send or receive data over the wire.

I decided to go with a wire instead of the wireless NRF transceivers as I found them to be unreliable when there are too many walls in between them, which there were many..

Additionally my Father told me there is an existing 4 wire cable from an old alarm system that was not being used anymore that stretched from where the control unit was going to be placed, to very near to the water tank.
Very convenient.

They are set up in a master slave configuration, the master being the sensor unit. In this configuration the bus (the wire) belongs to the sensor unit. This means that if a slave wants to send something it has to be granted permission by the master. In this case this is fine as the control unit does not send enything over the wire, it simply receives readings from the sensor unit every 3 seconds.

The control unit does not send anything over the wire because the bore hole pump switch was conveniently right next to where the control unit was going to be installed, so I decided to make it act as both the control unit and relay unit.

If there were to be 3 separate units connected to the same bus, ie a sensor, control and relay unit, it would have been wise to make the control unit the master, this way it could request sensor reading from the sensor unit every X seconds and act upon them by sending the relay unit commands, like turning the pump on or off.

I opted to make the sensor unit the slave in this case as I could not get the request/response model to work in time, but in this case it would not have mattered anyway as a separate relay unit was not needed

It worked quite well. The Only remaining potential issue was the possibility of 
erroneous sensor readings while the water was being pumped into the tank as the surface would be disturbed.

To test this I got a large pot, mounted the ultrasonic sensor above it and poured in some water, intentionally disturbing the surface.
There were some erroneous readings, although significantly less than I expected, and nothing that cant be handled in software.

The next step was to design a PCB board.

{/* I ended up with this:
//////////////////// Picture here

Here is the schematic:
//////////////////// Picture here */}

Each unit would share the same PCB design, bit with different components mounted to fulfill their different roles.
In theory this would allow one unit to act as the sensor, control and relay unit at the same time, if required to do so.

#### 1\. PCB

[![PCB variations](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/pcbs.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/pcbs.jpg)

I used PCBWay to manufacture the PCBs and got them around 2 weeks later.

Bottom left is a blank pcb without anything solder or attached.
Bottom right is a control unit, it has the LCD screen attached with a keypad, RS485 unit and a relay.
Top right is a sensor unit, it has the control board of the ultrasonic sensor attached in addition to a RS485 unit.
Top left is an example with an NRF 01 unit attached. It was not used in this project but reserved for possible future projects using this PCB.


#### 2\. Com and Power Cable

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/sensor_unit_testing.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/sensor_unit_testing.jpg)

In the top photo you can see the arduino being powered by the wire connected to it. I had to climb into the roof to find this wire.
Anyway, I attached a 9V battery to the known end in the tool shed and used a multi meter to test the wires in the roof of the house.
After extending the wire I routed it to where the control unit was going to be.

After that I attached the sensor unit to one end and the control unit to the other. I tested to see if the sensor unit can be powered through this wire in addition to using it to send sensor readings. Surprisingly it worked great.

#### 3\. Tank in bad shape

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/tank_problem.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/tank_problem.jpg)

Meanwhile, I climbed up the water tank and found the top to be bulged inward. How this happened I have no idea, but it wasn't good.
It might have result in a safety hazard if that water leaks into the tank so my Father and I decided to replace it.

#### 4\. Platform for new tank

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/platform_building.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/platform_building.jpg)

Here my Grandfather and one of his workers was busy constructing a platform for the new tank. This one was going to be placed on the ground and use a pressure pump. It was conveniently placed right next to the tool shed where the wire exits from.

#### 6\. Ultrasonic sensor

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/sensor_hole_outside.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/sensor_hole_outside.jpg)

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/sensor_mounted.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/sensor_mounted.jpg)

Here the sensor has been installed in the new water tank. I attached it with some superglue and used silicone to make the hole waterproof.
The sensor is waterproof by the way, but that water forming on the sensor due to the tanks humidity turned out to be an issue. For now my father has to clean it by hand every other day. We have discussed more permanent solutions and are working on it.

#### 9\.

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/testing_container.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/testing_container.jpg)

I wanted to place each unit in a neat little container so I went down to he local hardware shop and bought 2. They were perfect. Snug as a glove.
Here you can see me test fitting and later placing the sensor unit in the tool shed after drilling some holes.

#### 10\.

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/screen_cut.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/screen_cut.jpg)

For the control unit I used a Dremel tool to cut out a rectangle for the screen to fit in. For the keypad I cut a little slit for the membrane cable.

In retrospect I should have used my Fathers CnC machine but I did not think of that..

#### 12\.

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/ctrl_unit_installed.jpg)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/3_water_tank_system/ctrl_unit_installed.jpg)

And finally, here is the control unit with its relay after installation.

### Usage & Demo

What happens in the video?:  
The water level is currently at 79%. The system is set to stop filling the tank when reaching 80%.
After selecting the "FILL & AUTO" state the system turns on the pump (the relay can be heard clicking at 0:10), 
and turns it off when reaching 80%, after which it enters the "AUTO" state. 
The level briefly falls down to 78% due to erroneous sensor readings as the surface is disturbed by water entering the tank.

Pressing the left or right arrows loops through a list of "screens" (or pages if you prefer) on the display, each having a different purpose.
Pressing the up and down arrows changes the state the current screen represents.
And clicking the round Select button updates the state if it was changed.


The "screens" are:  
1\. Control  
This screen displays the current water level in the tank as a percentage, it is also used to change the unit's overall state.

The Control screen can be seen at timestamp 0:00 in the video.
Ctrl is the screen's name.
P:OFF represents the current pump state, the percentage is the water level and the "OFF" in the second row represent the current system state,
ie "OFF", "AUTO", "FILL & AUTO" or "FILL & OFF". 

While in the "OFF" state the pump will always be off, or turned off if it was running and the user switches to this state. 
The system will never turn the pump on in this state, the system can be considered dead, 
except that it will continue to show new water level readings.

In "AUTO" the system will automatically turn the pump on or off based on the upper and lower water level percentage bounds.
If the water level falls below the lower bound the pump will be turned on, if the water level reaches or exceeds the upper bound the pump will be turned off.
This cycle repeats while the system is in this state.

In "FILL & OFF" the system will immediately turn on the pump and fill the tank until the upper percentage bound is reached.
After which the system will enter the "OFF" state and wont perform any future operations.
This can be seen as "fill once and don't do anything afterwards".

"FILL & AUTO" will also immediately fill the tank from its current level and then enter the "AUTO" state.
Useful for if the user wants to top up the tank manually but have the system do it automatically afterwards.


Pressing the up and down arrows will switch between these states and pressing Select will put the system in the selected state as can be seen in timestamp 0:10.

2\. Stop Fill When
This screen sets the upper water bound as a percentage. 
The maximum value is 100%, and the value cannot be less than the lowest bound + 5%.


3\. Refill When
This screen sets the lower water bound as a percentage. 
It cannot be less than 0% and more than the upper bound - 5%.

4\. Sensor height Above Water
This screen sets the sensor height in cm above the maximum water level.
This is needed for calculating the percentage.

5\. Water Depth
This screen sets the maximum water depth in cm.
The sum of the water depth and sensor height cannot exceed 600cm as this is the maximum distance the sensor can take measurements.
Checks are in place to make sure this does not happen while setting the depth or sensor height. 

### Problems
The system has been working flawlessly for about 4 months at tht time of writing this, 
having filled the tank numerous times.
The only problem encountered is that water droplets form on the sensor head because of the hight humidity in the tank.
This causes false sensor readings and makes the system think the tank is 100% full.

Currently my father wipes off any water droplets from the sensor every other day or so.
We have discussed a few possible solutions and will be trying them in the future.
