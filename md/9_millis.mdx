### Intro
I recently started work on a project involving Raspberry Pi Picos running the arduino framework.
The Pi Pico's are expected to be powered continuously, during which the Arduino's millis() function may overflow,
leading to potential disastrous results if handled inappropriately.

What exactly are millis() used for? It is mainly used to execute certain code blocks at set intervals.

Here is an example without millis():

~~~ cpp
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED on
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second (1000ms)
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second (1000ms)
}
~~~

In this example a LED is turned on and off forever, at 1 second intervals. This is accomplished with delay().
But delay has issues. It completely pauses code execution on the arduino for the provided time in ms.
This is terrible news if the arduino should say, flicker a button and accept user input from a keypad at the same time.

To do both at the same time without pausing all code execution: enter millis().
How is it used?
Here is an example with the exact same behavior, but using millis():

~~~ cpp
const long interval = 1000;
unsigned long previousMillis = millis();

void loop() {
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
  
  if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, !digitalRead(LED_BUILTIN));
    previousMillis = currentMillis;
  }
}
~~~

This example is ever so slightly more complicated so lets run through it. 
The time interval is set in the first line, ie the LED will switch between being on and off every 1 second.
"previousMillis" will be set as 0 at the begging of code execution. This is used as a reference point to see if 1 second has passed or not.

In the loop, "currentMillis" is set. This is the current time that is later than "previousMillis".
In the if statement it is checked to see if the difference between "currentMillis" and "previousMillis" is greater than or equal to the interval.
If true, the if statement's body gets executed.

Here digitalRead is used to get the current on/off state of the led, which is then inverted with "!", turning the led off if it was on and vice versa.
After the LED's new state has been set, "previousMillis" gets assigned "currentMillis" and the cycle begins again.

What is important to note here is that there is no pause in code execution. 
The loop() function runs continuously, checking if the if statement is true, not dissimilar to asking "are we there yet?" all the time on a long trip.
But having the ability to do anything else between asking, like handling user input.

### The twist
The part that confused me is that every 50 or so days, millis() resets, restarting at 0ms.
The explanation is that the maximum value a unsigned long can be on the arduino is 4,294,967,295. 
Adding 1ms to the maximum value of 4,294,967,295ms results in overflow, the addition result being 0ms.

With that in mind, and swapping variable names for values, this is a possibility:
~~~ cpp
//if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval)
  if (100ms - 4294967000ms >= interval) {
    ....
  }
~~~

Here "previousMillis" was set 295ms before overflow, and the code segment captured 100ms after overflow, hence "currentMillis" is 100ms.
Logic would dictate that the if statement will never be true again, 
as the subtraction will always be a negative number and thus always be smaller than the interval of 1000ms.

But, both "currentMillis" and "previousMillis" are of type "unsigned long", meaning that they can only store positive numbers.
Subtraction between two unsigned longs can also only result in a positive number.
So what happens in this case?  
100ms - 4294967000ms = 395ms
