#### Backstory
My Girlfriend and I was planing to go on holiday, we decided to do a 8 day road trip down the Drakensburg Mountains and around Lesoto.
Driving from Johannesburg to Harry Smith, Sani Pass, Lady Gray, Bloemfontain and back to Johannesburg.

During budgeting we decided to use Marco Polo to calculate the fuel and toll costs for the trip.
I quicly listed all the addresses in an Excel document, loaded it into Marco Polo and got back the results.

Even though I wrote the app I was still surprised at the ease that it solved this budgeting problem for us.
This was not exactly as I intended it to be used, believing that it would suite businesses better than indivuduals going on a road trip.
But this got me thinking, the biggest problem and strength of MArco Polo is that it is a Excel Add In.
But what if I write a more accessable mobile version, one that the average traveler would like to use?

This is how the idea of ZA Route formed.


#### Planning

I did some research and found a few apps that solved this problem somewhat, but I believed I could do better.
Each one had some sort of issue or something I did not like.

It should be simple, easy to use and work on both mobile and desktop.

What a cliche set of requirements, but probably one of the most dreaded sentences a developer could hear.

The more grounded requirements were quite similar to the ones of Marco Polo.
Given a list of addresses, calculate the fastest route (if neccesary).

Show the route on a map, including toll gates.

Show usefull statistics about the route like Distance, time, fuel and toll costs.

Save and share the route.


#### Design Decisions

I entertained the thought of using Solid JS for this project, more specificaly Solid Start as I kept a close eye on that for a while.
I love the way it uses Remote Procedure Calls to fetch and mutate data, and that it's components only execute once.
The only issue was that it was still in Alpha.

At the end of the day I decided on Next JS as I was already familiar with React. 
My philosophy is that I will always try using some tool I am not comfortable with in each project I do, 
this time it being Next JS.

Aditionally I decided to move away from MUI and go with Tailwind only.
I dont usually climb on hype trains like the one for tailwind a while back, but I think it was justified that time.
I tried it and I really liked it. 
I was sold after reading the first few chapter of Refactoring UI, written by the creators of Tailwind.

Lastly I again used MongoDB, although I came to regret it later on.
The DB is great, I like using it, and I like the query language but it is not suitable for a low trafic serverless environment (Vercel).
Cold starts are extremely long, sometimes up to 9 seconds which is totally unexceptable.
More on this later.
