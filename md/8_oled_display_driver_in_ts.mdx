### Backstory

During my first year of university, my father gave me a Raspberry Pi 3B as a gift.
I loved it, it was the perfect complimentary gift to my CS degree.

But, I can still clearly recall the day I accidentally fried it when a loose jumper cable made contact with its circuit board...

I stared at it in disbelief, reconnecting the power cable, telling myself "its just a small malfunction, nothing to worry about".

But alas, it did not come back to life. It was dead. 
Sadness turned into anger a few years later when Raspberry Pi's nearly surpassed bitcoin in value due to shortages.

Anyway, what was notable of that moment was that I was trying to get a LCD1602 to work with the Pi.
