### Intro

During my first year of university, my father gave me a Raspberry Pi 3B as a gift.
I loved it, it was the perfect complimentary gift to my CS degree.

But, I can still clearly recall the day I accidentally fried it when a loose jumper cable made contact with its circuit board...

I stared at it in disbelief, reconnecting the power cable, telling myself "its just a small malfunction, nothing to worry about".

But alas, it did not come back to life. It was dead.   
Sadness turned into anger a few years later when Raspberry Pis nearly surpassed bitcoin in value due to shortages...

Anyway, what was notable of that moment was that I just got a LCD1602 to work with the Pi.
The Dunning-Kruger effect was strong at first when I opened the LCD's datasheet and thought, this is it, I'd be using it in no time.

Wrong.

Not understating a word, I soon downloaded a driver someone else wrote which worked perfectly.

But what stuck with me was a deep admiration for the people trained in the mystical art of reading a datasheet, understanding it,
and implementing a working driver according to its specifications.

### Devicescript

I stumbled upon Devicescript a few months ago and was intrigued. 
Typescript on micro controllers?
Native JSON? 
Support for JSX?

It sounded good, so I decided to try it out. I wanted to see how Typescript compares to C++ in a environment dominated by it.
After a few experiments and getting the hang of things, I realized... I was having a blast.

The project has been thought out really well, and it is chock full of interesting ideas.
I would urge anyone to give it a shot and make up their own mind about it.

But moving on to the display driver for now.

I have a small SH1106 OLED display that I wanted to try with devicescript, using JSX with it sounded cool.
But like any other platform, a driver is required to communicate with peripherals such as a display.
One such non existent driver was one for the SH1106.
So wanting to know more about the I2C protocol and how to write drivers, I decided to give it my best shot.

I did not spontaneously decide to write a driver for it, no, it took a while for the idea to fester. 
I first had to get over the self instilled fear of looking at datasheets.

What helped with that was the fact that a good driver already existed for the SH1106, written in C++ for the Arduino platform,
so I started by studying that.

I had a great interest in the I2C protocol as I used it in most of my prior micro controller projects, 
but I did not know how it works on a fundamental level, and I really like knowing the inner workings of stuff.
The same with drivers, so learning to write a driver that uses I2C was like killing two birds with one stone.

#### I2C

First, what is I2C exactly?

Each pin on a micro controller can be used to do something. 
They can be setup in such a way to control external components outside the micro controller.
A button for instance, requires one pin, a basic LCD1602 requires about 6 pins.

If each and every external component requires their own exclusive pins, you'll eventually run out of pins on the microcontroller.

Thankfully, back in 1982 some smart guys at Siemens were sitting with this exact predicament and they came up with I2C to solve their problem.

I2C allows up to 127 devices to communicate using only 2 pins. 
In other words, there are only 2 wires and each device wanting to communicate connects to these 2 wires using only 2 of their own pins.

SO that LCD1602 of earlier? Slap a I2C backplate on it and bring the wires down to 2.
Or, if you want to add another I2C device to expand the microcontroller's capabilities, simply connect it to the wires.

As you can see, I2C is a extremely useful protocol and knowing how it works can be quite beneficial.

So why only up to 127 devices on the wire? And how can each device be controlled individually? */}

### The SH1106 Display 

#### Pixel Layout

A characteristic of the display that I found very interesting is the way pixels are organized.
It might be different to what you expect.

Since the display is only monochrome, each pixel can be represented by a single bit, either on or off.
The most logical way to organize these bits are to treat them as bytes.
So if the display has a resolution of 128 x 64, that is 8192 pixels, or when divided by 8, 1024 bytes.

The way in which these bytes are organized are shown in the below image:

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/8_oled/pages.png)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/8_oled/pages.png)

The display is horizontally split into 8 sections called pages, 2 of which are partially\* shown in the image.
Each page is made up op 128 x 8 pixels, for a total resolution of 128 x 64.
As each page has a height of 8 pixels, each column in the page can be treated as a byte.

(\*Only an 8x8 section of the zeroth page is shown, in reality the page stretches to the right for an additional 120 bytes)

Tha "Data" Column with labels D0 to D7 represents the bit indexes of each byte in the page.

Each Page has a address as seen in the conveniently named "Page Address" column, with address 0 to 7.
Page addresses are used to tell the screen into which page to place the incoming data bytes being sent to it.

After a page has been selected, bytes can be sent to the display. 
After each successive data byte received, the display automatically increments the column address.
The display does not automatically increment the page address once the end of the a page is reached, 
although some displays do this as will be discussed later.

#### Writing data to the display

To write data to the display, the I2C protocol is used.  
But, what is I2C exactly?

Each pin on a micro controller can be used to do something. 
They can be setup in such a way to control external components outside the micro controller.
A button for instance, requires one pin, a basic LCD1602 requires about 6 pins.

If each and every external component requires their own exclusive pins, you'll eventually run out of pins on the microcontroller.

Thankfully, back in 1982 some smart guys at Siemens were sitting with this exact predicament, so they came up with I2C to solve their problem.

I2C allows up to 127 devices to communicate using only 2 pins. 
In other words, there are only 2 wires and each device wanting to communicate connects to these 2 wires using only 2 of their own pins.

So that LCD1602 of earlier? Slap a I2C backplate on it and bring the wires down to 2.

As you can see, I2C is a extremely useful protocol and knowing how it works can prove to be valuable insight.

Below is a visual representation of how a write sequence may look like:

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/8_oled/write.png)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/8_oled/write.png)
[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/8_oled/legends.png)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/8_oled/legends.png)

The write operation starts with a special start condition 'S', present on the very left of the image.
What happens during 'S', is that the voltage over the SDA wire goes from high to low while the SCL line stays idle.
This indicates to all the devices connected to the wires that they should expect a slave address to following, 
telling which ever device width that address that they have been selected to be communicated with. 
Imagine a teacher calling out a student's name in a classroom. Everyone hears the students name but only the student responds.

After the slave address has been transmitted the device with that address responds by sending an acknowledge condition, 
indicating to the master that the device exists and is ready.

The master can then proceed by sending a control byte.
Below is a control byte:

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/8_oled/control_byte.png)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/8_oled/control_byte.png)

A control byte consist of 8 bits, with the 2 most significant bits, C0 and DC having special meaning, the rest being padding. 
The slave sends an acknowledge ('A') after receiving the control byte.

The meaning of C0 and DC are as follows:

[![The add in](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/8_oled/co_dc.png)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/8_oled/co_dc.png)

So there are 2 types of bytes that can be sent to the display. Control Bytes and Data Bytes.
Data bytes are further split into 2 types, 
data bytes interpreted as command operations and data bytes interpreted as RAM operations.
The way the screen should interpret the data byte(s) depend on the preceding control byte.

Command operations tells the screen what to do, like selecting the page to write to. Clearing the display, inverting its pixels and so on.
Some other special Commands are sent to the screen during its startup procedure as well.

RAM operations simply tell the display what pixels should be on or off.
The display has a internal RAM/frame buffer that maps to the pixels of the display. Changing the bytes in RAM updates the display accordingly.

So if C0 is "0", all the bytes following the control byte will be data bytes concluding only when a stop condition is sent.
The data bytes can then either be interpreted as commands if D/C is "0" or as RAM operations if D/C is "1".

Transmitting a control byte when C0 is "1" may also be useful but I did not use it in my code. 
Compared to C0 being 0, it simply avoids a stop condition and the retransmission of the slave address when data bytes should be interpreted differently.

For instance, say a page should be selected, after which bytes will be written to RAM.  
When C0 is '1': (In the first Ctrl Byte only)  
S -> Addr -> Ctrl -> Page -> Ctrl -> RAM -> RAM -> .... -> RAM -> E  

Compared to when C0 is '0':  
S -> Addr -> Ctrl -> Page -> E  
S -> Addr -> Ctrl -> RAM -> RAM -> .... -> RAM -> E

S: Start Condition  
Addr: Slave Address  
Ctrl: Control Bytes  
Page: Page Address  
RAM: RAM operation  
E: End Condition  
(Omitted slave acknowledgements for simplicity)  

In the first case, Commands and Data may be transmitted to the display in a single write (and less operations in total), 
where in the second the same result can be achieved but over 2 writes (and more operations in total. When factoring in Acknowledgments the length is further increased).
The reason I chose the second option was that the code is simpler to read, and speed was not an issue at all, 
surprisingly so since the JS runs in a VM and my result in 10 to 100x slower execution speed than C++.
