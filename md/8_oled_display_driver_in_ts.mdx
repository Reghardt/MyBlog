### Intro

During my first year of university, my father gave me a Raspberry Pi 3B as a gift.
I loved it, it was the perfect complimentary gift to my CS degree.

But, I can still clearly recall the day I accidentally fried it when a loose jumper cable made contact with its circuit board...

I stared at it in disbelief, reconnecting the power cable, telling myself "its just a small malfunction, nothing to worry about".

But alas, it did not come back to life. It was dead.   
Sadness turned into anger a few years later when Raspberry Pis nearly surpassed bitcoin in value due to shortages...

Anyway, what was notable of that moment was that I just got a LCD1602 to work with the Pi.
The Dunning-Kruger effect was strong at first when I opened the LCD's datasheet and thought, this is it, I'd be using it in no time.

Wrong.

Not understating a word, I soon downloaded a driver someone else wrote which worked perfectly.

But what stuck with me was a deep admiration for the people trained in the mystical art of reading a datasheet, understanding it,
and implementing a working driver according to its specifications.

### Devicescript

I stumbled upon Devicescript a few months ago and was intrigued. 
Typescript on micro controllers?
Native JSON? 
Support for JSX?

It sounded good, so I decided to try it out. I wanted to see how Typescript compares to C++ in a environment dominated by it.
After a few experiments and getting the hang of things, I realized... I was having a blast.

The project has been thought out really well, and it is chock full of interesting ideas.
I would urge anyone to give it a shot and make up their own mind about it.

But moving on to the display driver for now.

Like any other "platform", a driver is required to communicate with peripherals.
One such non existent driver was one for the SH1106.
I badly wanted to use my SH1106.

I did not spontaneously decide to write a driver for it, no, it took a while to fester. 
I first had to get over the self instilled fear of looking at datasheets.

What helped with that was the fact that a good driver already existed for the SH1106 in C++ for the arduino platform, written by Adafruit,
so I started by studying that.
