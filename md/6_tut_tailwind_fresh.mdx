# Tutorial: Tailwind in Fresh with full intellisense support

### With help from the dark side...

Create a Fresh project by running the following in the command line:

~~~ powershell 
    deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev
~~~

Give it a name.  
Select "No" when it askes if you would like to use Tailwind CSS.  
Yes for VS code, that's the editor I am using.

Open the directory that Fresh made.

Create a folder in the root called "tailwind" and open it in a terminal, 
type "run npm init" and press enter.  
Keep on pressing enter until the prompts are gone.

Stil in the "tailwind" folder;  
type "npx tailwindcss init" in the terminal and run it.
Then copy the below into the tailwind.config.js file.

~~~ js
    // tailwind.config.js
    module.exports = {
        content: [
            "../routes/**/*.tsx", 
            "../islands/**/*.tsx", 
            "../components/**/*.tsx"
        ],
        theme: {
            extend: {},
        },
        plugins: [],
    }
~~~

Go to the "static" folder of Fresh.  
Create a folder in "static" called "css".  
In "css" create 2 files, one called "input.css" and the other "output.css"

Open "input.css" and paste the following inside:

~~~ css 
    /* input.css */
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
~~~

In the routes folder create a file called "_app.tsx".  
Copy the below content into it:

~~~ tsx

    import { AppProps } from "$fresh/server.ts";
    import { Head, asset } from "$fresh/runtime.ts";

    export default function App({ Component }: AppProps) {
    return(
            <html>
                <Head>
                    <link 
                        href={asset("/css/output.css")} 
                        rel="stylesheet" 
                    />          
                </Head>
                <body>
                    <Component />
                </body>
            </html>
        );
    }
~~~

Open "deno.json".
Modify the start task so it looks like:
~~~ json
    // deno.json 
    {
        "start": "cd tailwind; npx tailwindcss -i ../static/css/input.css -o ../static/css/output.css --watch & cd ..; deno run -A --watch=static/,routes/ dev.ts",
    }
~~~

Open a terminal in the root directory of Fresh and run "deno task start".

You now have full featured Tailwind CSS working in Deno JS with intellisense.
