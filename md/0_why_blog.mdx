In his book Range, David Epstein writes about a study in which researchers Taylor and Greve analysed the commercial success of thousands of comic books from 234 publishers since 1971.

They wanted to find out what best predicted the financial success of comic book creators, and what could increase their value variance, or in other words: the chance that a creator makes a comic book that failed badly or exceeds expectations compared to their usual work.

Taylor and Greve made some predictions; 
1. Creators learn from repetition and the creators making the most comics in a given amount of time would make better ones on average.
2. The more resources a publisher had the better their creator's comics would be.
3. As a creator's years of experience increases, the better their comics would be.

All three predictions were wrong.

It turned out that high repetition workloads had a detrimental impact on performance, years of experience had zero effect and the amount of available resources didn't mean anything.

They found the strongest predictor to be the number of genres a creator has worked in. That is, a creator's breadth of experience predicted the success of their comic books and not length of experience. Breadth made creators more likely to innovate and better on average.

A creator who had worked in 4 or more genres was more innovative than a team who had collective experience in the same number of genres.

As Taylor and Greve put it: “Individuals are capable of more creative integration of diverse experiences than teams are.”
