### Motivation:

In his book Range, David Epstein writes about a study in which researchers Taylor and Greve analyzed the commercial success of thousands of comic books from 234 publishers since 1971.  

They wanted to find out what best predicted the financial success of comic book creators, and what could increase their value variance, or in other words: the chance that a creator makes a comic book that failed miserably or exceeds expectations compared to their usual work.

Taylor and Greve made some predictions;

1. Creators learn from repetition and the ones making the most comics in a given amount of time would make better ones on average.
2. The more resources a publisher had the better their creator's comics would be.
3. As a creator's years of experience increases, the better their comics becomes.

All three predictions were wrong.

It turned out that high repetition workloads had a detrimental impact on performance, years of experience had zero effect and the amount of available resources didn't mean much.

They found the strongest predictor to be the number of genres a creator has worked in. That is, a creator's breadth of experience predicted the success of their comic books and not length of experience. Breadth made creators more likely to innovate and better on average.

A creator who had worked in 4 or more genres was more innovative than a team who had collective experience in the same number of genres.

As Taylor and Greve put it: “Individuals are capable of more creative integration of diverse experiences than teams are.”

### Application to software development:

Ever since I read the book I have been applying what I learned to my work.
I used to try and stick to the tools I am comfortable with but I started to branch out and try new things, even if I did not necessarily like some tool or idea at first.

I found this "try it and broaden your horizons" mentality helped me get over many mental blocks I've built over the years.
Like believing that the tools I use are the best and only tools one should use, and anything else is inferior and not worth the time.

On the contrary, I found value in every single thing I explored that fell outside my comfort zone.
Be it the idea, or the way a tool does something, or the mental model required to think about the subject, or simply a surprising line of code.
I have come to like those "aha" moments when there is a sudden sense of clarity about the thing I am learning, that feeling one gets that everything makes sense now.
{/* It must be how it feels for adrenaline junkies to skydive or jump a bike. */}

I am pleasantly surprise when my predefined idea of how something probably works gets shattered by how it actually works.
That is how I know I have broaden my horizons, when I am exposed to something that I myself would have been unable to think of.

### Takeaway:

I intend to make myself valuable by having a broad (and deep) understanding of many areas in the context of software and hardware (among others) 
and being able to integrate that many diverse areas of knowledge needed to create something new and valuable.

{/* I intend to broaden my horizon as much as possible, imagine a see filled with knowledge and experience, wide as to cover a lot of area, and deep in the places that matter most. */}

In this blog I will learn as much as possible and publish my explorations for others to use and learn from.



{/* The book has many more such fascinating examples and I would urge anyone to read it 

This book greatly influenced the way I approach new projects. 
Where in the past I tended to stick with the tools I'm comfortable with, now I intentionally try and learn the tools that I'm uncomfortable with.

This has allowed me to broaden my knowledge extensively, and learn at a fast pace

I do not intend to jump on every hot new thing that makes an appearance, 
I intend to learn what is valuable, not always necessarily monetarily, but valuable in terms of broadening my horizon.

My goal is to have at least some experience with as many tools as possible, , I want to be able to pool a wide range of knowledge from many areas into a project.

{/* There are so many ideas and ways of doing things out there, all of which are beautiful in their own right, I think it'll be a shame not to seek them out or at least know of them.

Even though writing comic books and software development are two different fields, I believe the findings of this study (and the rest of Range) can be applied to software development, which I intend to do. This blog is meant to show my journey in learning as much as possible.

I don't intend to be a trend hopper, jumping on the next hot thing every time it gets released, but rather, I want to study every tool as a learning opportunity. I want to understand what it does well and when to use it.

Imagine a wide sea of knowledge, with deep canyons or trenches where it matters most. Extracting knowledge from as wide a range as possible and applying it appropriately and efficiently to the problems at hand.

In this blog I will learn new things, I intend to be intentionally uncomfortable. */}
