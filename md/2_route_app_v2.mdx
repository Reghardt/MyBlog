### Backstory
My Girlfriend and I was planing to go on holiday, we decided to do a 8 day road trip down the Drakensberg Mountains and around Lesotho.
Driving from Johannesburg to Harry Smith, Sani Pass, Lady Gray, Bloemfontein and back to Johannesburg.

During budgeting we decided to use Marco Polo to calculate the fuel and toll costs for the trip.
I quickly listed all the addresses in an Excel document, loaded it into Marco Polo and got back the results.

Even though I wrote the app I was still surprised at the ease that it solved this budgeting problem for us.
This was not exactly as I intended it to be used, believing that it would suite businesses better than individuals going on a road trip.
But this got me thinking, the biggest problem and strength of MArco Polo is that it is a Excel Add In.
But what if I write a more accessible mobile version, one that the average traveler would like to use?

This is how the idea of ZA Route formed.


### Planning

I did some research and found a few apps that solved this problem somewhat, but I believed I could do better.
Each one had some sort of issue or something I did not like.

It should be simple, easy to use and work on both mobile and desktop.

What a cliche set of requirements, but probably one of the most dreaded sentences a developer could hear.

The more grounded requirements were quite similar to the ones of Marco Polo.
Given a list of addresses, calculate the fastest route (if necessary).

Show the route on a map, including toll gates.

Show useful statistics about the route like Distance, time, fuel and toll costs.

Save and share the route.


### Design Decisions

I entertained the thought of using Solid JS for this project, more specifically Solid Start as I kept a close eye on that for a while.
I love the way it uses Remote Procedure Calls to fetch and mutate data, and that it's components only execute once.
The only issue was that it was still in Alpha.

At the end of the day I decided on Next JS as I was already familiar with React. 
My philosophy is that I will always try using some tool I am not comfortable with in each project I do, 
this time it being Next JS.

Additionally I decided to move away from MUI and go with Tailwind only.
I don't usually climb on hype trains like the one for tailwind a while back, but I think it was justified that time.
I tried it and I really liked it. 
I was sold after reading the first few chapter of Refactoring UI, written by the creators of Tailwind.

Lastly I again used MongoDB, although I came to regret it later on.
The DB is great, I like using it, and I like the query language but it is not suitable for a low traffic serverless environment (Vercel).
Cold starts are extremely long, sometimes up to 9 seconds which is totally unacceptable.
More on this later.

### Development

I started with the "core" of the app, which is google maps.
The challenge was to make it easy to interact with maps.
There are two components to this. One is google maps, (scroll, zoom, swipe etc) and the other is the UI to interact and manipulate maps on a deeper level. 
Either directly (specify addresses, find route, reorder addresses etc)
or indirectly (save route, recent addresses, notes).
The later should also display useful information about the route (fuel costs, toll costs, time, distance).

At first I used the same approach I used in Marco Polo, the maps component was at the top of the page and the "manipulate/information" component was below that.
But especially on mobile this meant that the user would have scrolled down each time they wanted to make a change and scroll back up to see the change on the map.

This was bad, it should not feel like effort to see a change reflect.

The solution came when using the swipe down menu on my phone: turn the manipulate/information component into an overlay with a simple toggle.
This worked very well. Now a user can simply toggle the overlay and see what is happening on the map below.
No scrolling, no wasted time and no losing track of the last scroll position.

Next was fleshing out the manipulate/information component. This was split up into 2 parts as well. 
The first part was where the user could list their addresses and the second was statistics about the route generated from the addresses.
The statistics (fuel costs, toll costs, time, distance) per address was displayed in sequence in a simple table, but I did not like it as it felt to decoupled from the address list.
For instance, if you looked at the table and wanted to delete an address you had to scroll up and delete it in die address list. 
This meant that there was 2 copies of each address. One that is editable and one that displayed statistics.
I decided to try and merge the manipulation and statistics parts together.

Here you can see how the overlay works and how statistics are presented:

[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/open_close.gif)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/open_close.gif)

### Use Case

#### 1\.

[![Login Page](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/login.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/login.PNG)

Whats this?: 
This is the login page. Middleware on the server checks if a valid bearer token 
exists on the client's request, if not, the user gets redirected here. 
If a valid token does exist they can proceed to use the app.


How does it work?:  
Login with google creates a bearer token using Next Auth. 
The bearer contains the user's google ID, 
used to identify the user for subsequent server calls.
On first login the user is navigated to the map. 
On subsequent logins they are navigated the "saved routes" page.

#### 2\.
[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/first_page.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/first_page.PNG)
Whats this?:  
This is the page a user sees on first login,
,it's the overlay on top of the map from earlier.

The overlay is used to manipulate google maps and to see statistics about the route.
Taping the round button in the bottom right toggles the visibility of the overlay.

How does it work?:  
Note that the top right displays the number of tokens available to a user.
Users receive 50 tokens for free when registering.
Tokens are consumed when a user searches for an address and when routes are found.
They can purchase additional tokens in the token store if they run out. 
More on that later.

#### 2\.
[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/start_address.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/start_address.PNG)
[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/start_address_on_map.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/start_address_on_map.PNG)

Whats this?:  
Here I specified the start address, which is Johannesburg.
Note a token has been subtracted.
It can also be seen on the map as seen in the second screenshot.

How does it work?:  
It uses the google autocomplete API,
so a user can search for anything they are used to on google maps while also receiving suggestions.

The server receives the name of the action that was completed by the user,
like "address_solved" or "route_found". 
It then subtracts the associated amount of tokens from the user's tokens and sends the new amount back to the client.
All actions consume 1 token at the moment.

Once an address has been solved, 
google returns its coordinates which is used to place a custom marker on the map.

#### 3\.
[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/stopovers.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/stopovers.PNG)
[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/stopovers_added.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/stopovers_added.PNG)

Whats this?:  
Here I added 4 stopovers. In the first image you can see the "Add Stopover" button
and the number of stopovers next to that.
Tokens have not been consumed yet in the first image, 
as only the placeholder slots for four stopovers have been created.

In the second image you can see 3 of the four stopovers and the appropriate number of tokens consumed.
I also added some simple demo notes to the addresses.

How does it work?:  
The addresses are objects stored in an array. 
The first and last elements are treated as the start and end addresses.
Elements in between are treated as stopovers.
Each stopover has controls for swapping itself with the above or below stopover.
A stopover cannot be swapped with a start or stop address.
Usage of the "history" button will be shown next.


#### 4\.

[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/recent_addresses.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/recent_addresses.PNG)

Whats this?:  
This is the recent addresses. 
It can be used to use load previously used addresses without consuming a token.
It is open by pressing the history button, 
the address or stopover who's history button was pressed will receive the desired address.
Here I invoked it on the end address and selected Johannesburg.

How does it work?:  
The addresses are saved locally on the users device by using IndexedDB.
I used the IDB package that makes it easier to use.

Addresses are listed according to usage.
In this example Johannesburg will be at the top next time the popover opens.

#### 5\.
[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/route_found.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/route_found.PNG)

Whats this?: 
Here you can see the route generated by pressing the "Find Route" button.
Johannesburg is both the start and end address.
1 to 4 are the stopovers.
The "T" icons are toll gates on the trip.

How does it work?:  
The route is generated by Google's Routes API.
It returns the path that is displayed on the map.

The app additionally displays Tolls on the route as it has a list of all the toll gates in south Africa including their coordinates and prices.
To check if a toll gate is on the route, the Google Maps Geometry library is used.
It checks if a toll gate is within a given distance of a poly line.
Each toll gate may have more than one coordinate as some have ramp plazas.
If a toll stretches over a wide double road highway each side has a separate coordinate as well.
At first I only placed one coordinate in between the roads and relaxed the margins of the Geometry library,
but this caused issues as sometimes the library might mistake a ramp as being on the route as well.
So I opted for very tight tolerances and multiple coordinates to eliminate errors.

All the markers are custom made React components placed there with a Portal.

#### 6\.
[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/stopover_stats.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/stopover_stats.PNG)

[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/route_stats.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/route_stats.PNG)

Whats this?:  
After thr route has been generated, statistics about the route is shown.
Statistics about the whole route and address to address statistics.

How does it work?:  
The route is separated into legs, the distance and duration of each leg is used to display inter address statistics.
To get the tolls, you can think of it as a imaginary box that is drawn around each leg.
A search is then done to see which tolls fall into the box.
Those filtered tolls are then tested to see if they are on the path of the leg.
I did not test to see if there is a performance improvement, so this might be a case of premature optimization.


#### 6\.
[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/trip_name.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/trip_name.PNG)

[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/save_confirm.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/save_confirm.PNG)

Whats this?: 
After a route has been found for the given addresses, 
it is possible to save the route for later use.
In the top image a name is given to the route, with a short note.

In the bottom image the app asks for conformation.
The tabs will be explained later.

How does it work?:  
The app saves the route on MongoDB, giving it a unique ID that can be used to retrieve it.

#### 7\.

[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/saved_route.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/saved_route.PNG)

Whats this?:  
Here you can see the saved route. 
It looks similar to the former steps but here the route is not meant to be edited, 
but instead used for navigation.


If the need arises to edit the route this can be done by clicking on "Edit Route".
If it is the owner of the route the original route will be edited.
If the route was shared with someone via whatsapp, 
a copy of the route with a new ID will be created and edited which can then be saved.

If the owner of route sends the route to a delivery driver, 
and edits the route at a later date, the edit will be reflected on the drivers phone as the ID stays the same. 

How does it work?:  
The route is saved to the DB and given an unique ID. The route document contains the ID of its owner.
At the moment anyone with the route ID can open the route, which can lead to privacy issues.
A authorize feature will be added later.

#### 8\.

[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/saved_stopover_stats.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/saved_stopover_stats.PNG)


[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/saved_route_stats.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/saved_route_stats.PNG)
Whats this?:  
Here you can see the body of the saved route.
It looks similar to the when it was being edited.
Clicking on the "road sign" buttons opens google map with the corresponding address loaded as the destination.

How does it work?: 
It opens Google Maps on any device by using a Maps URL, which is a universal cross platform URL to launch Google Maps.


#### 9\.
[![Overlay and Statistics](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/saved_routes.PNG)](https://remblog.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/2_route_app_v2/saved_routes.PNG)

Whats this?: 
This is the app's menu. From here new routes can be created or saved routes can be opened and viewed like in the pervious images.
The drop down at the top can switch between "Personal" and "Business", although business is grayed out at the moment.
Business will allow all people belonging to that business to use the same token pool.

How does it work?: 
Not much to explain really, some simple DB manipulations and queries.


### Additional Features

#### 1\. Tabs

My father and I went on holiday to Sodwana for a week at the start of the year.
We could drive from Louis Trichardt to Sodwana directly or sleep over in Hoedspruit.

We wanted to know which option would be best.

At that time I already had a basic version of ZA Route working so I opened it and checked the statistics on the direct route.
I then added a stopover in Hoedspruit to see how that compares, wiping out the statistics of the direct route.

It immediately became apparent that this might be a common use case, 
but one that my app cant handle properly as this was not an efficient way to compare alternative routes.

Thats when I got the idea of implementing route tabs, to easily and efficiently switch between and compare alternate routes.

This is how they work:
